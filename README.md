# C JVM

Basic implementation of a JVM in C because I like it better than Rust (just don't leak memory lol).

Reads a .class file and executes its instructions.

> Only supports printing to the console strings, bytes, shorts, integers or floats

Oracle JVM specifications:
- [Class File Format](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html)
- [JVM Instruction Set](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html)

### You code in Java, I code Java we are not the same.
